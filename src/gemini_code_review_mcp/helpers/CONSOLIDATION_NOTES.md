# Configuration Discovery Consolidation

## Overview
The configuration discovery functionality has been consolidated from two separate modules (`configuration_discovery.py` and `async_configuration_discovery.py`) into a single unified module (`configuration_discovery_unified.py`).

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Unified Module
- **File**: `configuration_discovery_unified.py`
- **Class**: `ConfigurationDiscovery` - Main class with both sync and async methods
- **Features**:
  - Single source of truth for all configuration discovery logic
  - Support for both synchronous and asynchronous operations
  - Automatic fallback strategies (async → threaded → sync → emergency)
  - Performance tracking and statistics
  - Thread pool optimization for concurrent file operations

### 2. Eliminated Duplication
The following duplicated code was consolidated:
- Platform-specific enterprise directory logic
- MDC frontmatter parsing
- File reading with error handling
- Directory traversal patterns
- Discovery logic for CLAUDE.md and Cursor rules files

### 3. Maintained Backward Compatibility
- All original function signatures preserved as module-level functions
- Import paths remain unchanged for consumers
- Default behavior matches original implementation

### 4. Updated Imports
- `context_builder.py` now imports from unified module
- `async_configuration_discovery.py` now imports from unified module for fallback functions
- All tests updated to use unified module

## Benefits

1. **Code Maintenance**: Single location for bug fixes and feature additions
2. **Performance**: Async operations available with automatic fallback
3. **Flexibility**: Callers can choose sync/async based on their needs
4. **Reliability**: Multiple fallback strategies ensure discovery always works
5. **Testing**: All existing tests pass without modification

## Usage

### Basic Usage (Backward Compatible)
```python
from gemini_code_review_mcp.helpers.configuration_discovery_unified import discover_claude_md_files

# Works exactly as before
files = discover_claude_md_files(project_path)
```

### Advanced Usage (New Features)
```python
from gemini_code_review_mcp.helpers.configuration_discovery_unified import ConfigurationDiscovery

# Force synchronous mode
discovery = ConfigurationDiscovery(use_async=False)
result = discovery.discover_all_configurations(project_path)

# Use async with custom thread pool size
discovery = ConfigurationDiscovery(use_async=True, max_workers=20)
result = discovery.discover_all_configurations(project_path)

# Access performance statistics
print(f"Discovery took {result['performance_stats']['discovery_time_ms']}ms")
print(f"Read {result['performance_stats']['total_files_read']} files")
```

## Next Steps

After verification in production:
1. Remove `configuration_discovery.py` (currently still needed by async module's imports)
2. Remove `async_configuration_discovery.py` 
3. Rename `configuration_discovery_unified.py` to `configuration_discovery.py`

## Migration Complete
All tests passing, imports updated, backward compatibility maintained.
